AI for Fast Urban Wind Velocity Prediction

This repository contains code for generating a U-Net model for predicting pedestrian level wind velocities for any urban layout.

Pre-trained models for obtaining U/V/W velocities and the data-set are also available upon request, although they are too large for uploading to this current github repository.
